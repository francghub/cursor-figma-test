            AMRO is a festival about critical positions and artistic investigations at the intersection of art and digital technology, currently dealing with "the radical openness" both as a principle and as challenge. It is based by a variety of FLOSS-based cultures for artistic research and is currently being led by the cultural organization servus.at. Located in Linz (AT), AMRO positions itself against commercialization, creating an event that focuses on the interrelationships among art and digital technologies. The main target groups are artists, theoreticians, IT professionals, and students, as well as activists with interests in FLOSS initiatives and practices whose research focuses on alternative modes of production, alternative approaches to intellectual property rights, information design methods, and other interdisciplinary aspects of a 'open source' in thinking, doing, and showing. Accordingly, the presented works are intended to challenge 'openness' on different levels: technical specifications, open intellectual property, open access to knowledge, and open forms in thinking, and showing.
